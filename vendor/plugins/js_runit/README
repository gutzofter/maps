=======

Just a little unit tester. Very basic, but it does the job.

Netbeans:
open index.rhtml in \app\view\js_runit. Run file.

-or-

Execute at command line: ruby script/server.
Open web browser. Enter URL: http://localhost:3000/js_runit/index

Make changes to tested code. Hit refresh to re-execute tests.
